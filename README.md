## 🔍 About Me  
I hold a Bachelor of Commerce (BCom) degree and began my tech career with one year at Tata Consultancy Services (TCS), working with the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js). I have experience in back-end development, API design, authentication/authorization (JWT, bcrypt, CORS), and serverless deployment (Vercel).  
I’ve also worked in marketing at Tata Motors, giving me a strong business and systems perspective.

Currently I’m working as a Junior Full Stack Developer at HubbleHox with a package of 6 LPA, where I’m expanding my expertise into Nest.js, Next.js, Docker, and Kubernetes — aiming for a 10 LPA remote role.
